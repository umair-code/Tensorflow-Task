# Tensorflow-Task
::(File:Tensorflow constant.py) The default graph now has three nodes: two constant() ops and one add() op. To actually adding the matrices, and get the result of the addition, we must launch the graph in a session.

To launch computational graph create a session object but without arguments session launch a default graph. 
We should install library module before run this code from “pip install” 

::(File:Tensorflow variable.py) In this case , we are using variables to initialize with the value 6 and value 8 because Tensor Flow does not automatically initialize variables.

Always remember when we are working with variables to add global initializer. If we are not using global function to initialize variables then we need to initialize each variables separately. 

::(File:Tensorflow placeholder.py) Tensor Flow can handle more complicated inputs. In placeholder file we defined four placeholders a, b, weight1, weight2

Note:  EVERY INTERPRETER PERFORM DIFFERENT FUNCTIONALITY LIKE ANACONDA , PYCHARM, VISUAL STUDIO ETC. YOU SHOULD INSTALL PACKAGES OR MODULES BEFORE RUN THIS CODE. HERE’S PACKAGE NAME “tensorboard, tensorflow, tensorflow-estimator’
